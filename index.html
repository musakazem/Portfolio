		<h1>Using AutoCad to create a complete building floor plan
		</h1>
		<p id="publish-date">Published on </p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>The goal of this project was to mainly showcase my proficiency at using AutoCAD. All aspects of this plan have been completed and submitted within a period of one week. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Finishing a project within a time limit has taught me the importance of using shortcuts effectively and compartmentalizing different aspects into neat orders to achieve higher efficiency. It also taught me the importance of paying attention to details that make it more presentable to clients, such as adding blocks that represent cars, gym equipment etc.

				The images below are the original pdf files that I replicated from on AutoCad. (Please refresh page if images do not appear)

			<p>Below are a few details on the building plan mentioned above, to view my results click here.

			</p>
			<h2>Plan details</h2>
			<p>
				
				
				This residential apartment building consists of a total of 9 floors, two of them underground. The underground floors are made up of one underground parking and the other a basement. Ground floor consists of a lobby and parking space. Rest of the floors are used as residential apartments, each floor housing two units. The building has one elevator shaft and one stairwell.


			</p>
			<p>
				Also something to note, the building is open towards the north and partially blocked by a five storey building towards East and a 9 storey towards West and completely blocked by a 5 storey towards the South.

			</p>

			<h3>Apartments</h3>

			<p>The two apartment units at each floor have a size of 250 and 60 meter square each.
			</p>

				Unit 1 (250 meter square):
				<ul>
					<li>3 Bedrooms</li>
